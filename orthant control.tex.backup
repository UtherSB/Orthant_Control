\abstract{Pure state control is control on an open convex cone in a linear vector space. This can be seen most clearly in the covariance matrix determination of Gaussian states. The field of cone control is active and hence we attempt to translate some of the discovered theorems over to conditions on our symeplectic algebra generators.}

\section{Physical background}
From Lerner, $\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R}) \cong \operatorname{U}(n)\times \operatorname{Sp}_+(2n,\mathbb{R})$, where $\operatorname{Sp}_+(2n,\mathbb{R}) = \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R}) \cap \{\text{symmetric positive definite matrices}\}$. The isotropy group of the pure Gaussian states is $\operatorname{U}(n)$ and therefore the manifold of pure Gaussian states is diffeomorphic to $\operatorname{Sp}_+(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This corresponds to the set of pure covariance matrices. We know that $\operatorname{Sp}_+(2n,\mathbb{R})$ is diffeomorphic to the open convex cone $\operatorname{Sym}(n,\mathbb{R}) \times \operatorname{Sym}_+(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset \operatorname{Sym}(n,\mathbb{R}) \times \operatorname{Sym}(n,\mathbb{R})$. (Just as an aside, note that this open cone is diffeomorphic to the whole space). To visualise its form it is $n(n+1)$-dimensional wedge in $\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)}$.

We are just dealing with vector spaces and so we look for control theorems on open convex cones in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Note that in the following theorems these conditions will be one matrices that are defined to act on our covariance matrices, seen as vectors in a vector space. It will then be necessary to translate these conditions into condition on Lie algebra generators.

\section{Control theorems}
\subsection{Notation}
\begin{definition}
 $\mathbb{R}_+^n := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n | x \geq 0\}$. $\mathring{\mathbb{R}}_+^n$ is the interior of this set.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 $A \trianglelefteq 0$ if $j \neq i$, $A_{ij} \geq 0$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Boothby result from Elliott}
Consider the control equation
\begin{equation}
 \dot{x} = (A+uB)x \quad \text{on} \quad \mathbb{R}_+^n, A \triangleleft 0 \label{eq:conecont}
\end{equation}

Note that here we are dealing with the non-negative convex cone, which Boothby then switches to become the interior of this. This is fine, although a little confusing. Our cone, however, is not a positive orthant but a wedge where it is positive in some dimensions but free in others. Hence proposition \ref{thm:nsposbil} may not hold for our matrices.

\begin{proposition}
 If $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ a necessary and sufficient condition for (\ref{eq:conecont}) to be a
positive bilinear system is that $A \trianglelefteq 0$ and $B$ is diagonal; if $\Omega = [0, 1]$ then the condition is: the off-diagonal elements of $B$ are nonnegative. \label{thm:nsposbil}
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Boothby] Suppose the real matrices $A$, $B$ satisfy $A \trianglelefteq 0$ and $B = \operatorname{diag}(\beta_1 , \ldots , \beta_n )$. If there exists a vector $p \geq 0$ such that
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\sum_{i=1}^np_i\beta_i = 0 \text{ and}$
\item $\sum_{i=1}^np_iA_{ii} \geq 0,$
 \end{enumerate}
then (\ref{eq:conecont}) is not controllable on $\mathring{\mathbb{R}}_+^n$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Sachkov1997}
Consider the bilinear control system
\begin{equation}
 \dot{x} = \left(A+\sum_{i=1}^mu_iB_i\right)x \label{eq:sachkoveq}
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $u$ unbounded. Assume positive bilinear a la proposition \ref{thm:nsposbil}. Assume linear independence of the $B$s.

Propose solution for systems of codimension 1 and 2 ($m=n-1$ and $m=n-2$). Sufficient conditions for $m \leq n-2$.

\subsection{Boothby from Sachkov}
$m=n$. System \ref{eq:sachkoveq} is controllable.

\subsection{Boothby from Sachkov}
There are results for $m=1$, possibly same as above.

\subsection{Bacciotti}
$m=1$, $n=2$ totally solved by Bacciotti.

\subsection{Sachkov1995, from his 1997 paper}
$m=1$ $n>2$. System \ref{eq:sachkoveq} is generically uncontrollable.

\subsection{Note?}
``So the problem was solved for extreme codimensions $0$ and $n-1$.''

Codimension 0 is just $m=n$. 

Codimension $n-1$ is a case either where $m=1$ and $n>m$ or where $m = 2n - 1$
